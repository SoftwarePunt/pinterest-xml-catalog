# pinterest-xml-catalog

**Unofficial PHP Library for generating Pinterest Catalogs in XML (RSS 2.0, ATOM 1.0) format**

This can be used to generate a [data source](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/data-source-ingestion) for
daily product ingestion by Pinterest. You must already have
a [business account](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/get-a-business-account) and
a [claimed website](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/claim-your-website) that meets
their [merchant guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/en/merchant-guidelines).

You can use this to help convert product data to XML, but you'll have to serve the output yourself.

## Installation

Add the library to your project via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/):

```bash
composer require softwarepunt/pinterest-xml-catalog
```

### Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- `ext-dom`

## Usage

### Creating an XML catalog

Collect your product data, and then feed it into a `XmlCatalog` instance.

```php
<?php

use SoftwarePunt\PinterestXmlCatalog\XmlCatalog;
use SoftwarePunt\PinterestXmlCatalog\Models\ProductData;

// Create a new, blank catalog
$xmlCatalog = new XmlCatalog();

// Gather product data
$product = new ProductData();
$product->id = "4000086";
$product->title = "Illuminating Makeup Mirror";
$product->description = "A ring light mirror with 23 LED strip lights.";
$product->link = "https://www.example.com/cat/illuminating-makeup-mirror";
$product->imageLink = "https://www.example.com/media/catalog/product/image.jpg";
$product->additionalImageLink = "https://www.example.com/media/catalog/product/image_side.jpg";
$product->price = "14,99 EUR";

// Add products to catalog (can be ProductData, other object, or data array)
$xmlCatalog->addProduct($product);

// Convert to XML and serve as response
echo $xmlCatalog->toXmlString();

```

### Product data

Pinterest uses the Google Merchant Data [specifications](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en) for
RSS 2.0, which you can refer to for documentation on the specific fields used.

ðŸ‘‰ This library currently only targets fields that are in the
Pinterest [sample](https://help.pinterest.com/sub/helpcenter/assets/pinterest_product_sample_xml_feed.xml.zip)
or [docs](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/before-you-get-started-with-catalogs), not the full
Google-supported set of fields.

Using the `ProductData` class is recommended because it contains relevant phpdocs to make your life easier. You can also
pass your own associative array or object for each product to `addProduct()` if you prefer.

If you are adding products from your own object or array, you should make sure that the property names / array keys can
be understood by the library. For example, if you want to set the Google Product Category, valid keys to set it
are `googleProductCategory`, `g:google_product_category` and `google_product_category`.
